# Feature Matching Project

## Project Overview
This project implements an advanced feature matching system that combines ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) and SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithms to find correspondences between images. The system is designed to be robust, efficient, and capable of handling various image transformations.

## Implementation Details

### Feature Extraction
- Converts images to grayscale
- Detects keypoints and computes descriptors using both ORB and SIFT
- Combines features from both detectors for robust matching

### Feature Matching
- Builds KD-Tree index for efficient nearest neighbor search
- Implements branch and bound search for optimization
- Uses distance ratio test for initial matching

## Performance Analysis

### Feature Detection
- ORB: Fast detection with good scale invariance
- SIFT: More robust but computationally intensive
- Combined approach provides balance of speed and accuracy

### Matching Performance
- KD-Tree indexing for efficient search
- Branch and bound optimization for faster matching
- Spatial verification reduces false positives

## Results

### Sample Run Results
- Template image: 216 ORB + 101 SIFT features
- Target image: 3000 ORB + 2000 SIFT features
- Processing time: ~16.45 seconds
- Verified matches: 6 (from 7 potential matches)

### Output
- Visual representation of matches
- Match statistics and metrics
- Debug information when enabled
